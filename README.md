## ⚠️ Prototype Notice

This project is currently a **prototype**. Due to tight deadlines and a demanding release schedule at my company, I have not had the time to enhance, fix all bugs, or fully polish the implementation as originally intended.

This was a very challenging and busy week, and while the core functionality is here, some features may be incomplete or require further refinement.

Thank you for understanding, and feel free to contribute improvements or report any issues!
